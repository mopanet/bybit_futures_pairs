# Bybit Futures Pairs by Market Cap

This Python script fetches the list of Bybit linear futures pairs, filters for USDT pairs, sorts them by market cap, and outputs the top pairs in a format suitable for importing to TradingView.

## Features

- Fetches Bybit futures pairs using the Bybit API
- Filters only the pairs that are USDT-based
- Sorts the pairs by market cap (24h volume * last price)
- Limits the output to the top 50 pairs (can be configured)
- Outputs the symbols in a comma-separated list for easy import to TradingView

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

You can install the required dependencies with the following:

```bash
pip install requests
````

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Modify the `MAX_PAIRS` variable in the script to adjust the number of pairs you want to fetch (default is 50).
3. Run the script:

```bash
python bybit_futures_pairs.py
```

4. The output will be a comma-separated list of USDT futures pairs, sorted by market cap.

## Example Output

```
BTCUSDT,ETHUSDT,LTCUSDT,...
```

You can then import this list into TradingView for analysis.
